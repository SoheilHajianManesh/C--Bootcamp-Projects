## Tasks <a name="tasks"></a>

### Task1: Generic Heap <a name="t1"></a>

Design and implement a generic Heap data structure that incorporates the following features:

1. Custom Printing: The heap should support custom printing through an interface named IPrintable.
2. Custom Prioritization: The heap should allow custom prioritization of elements via an interface named IComparable.

### Task2: Data Transfer Object <a name="t2"></a>

Develop a program that reads data from provided datasets and maps it to a final Order model, following the exercise conducted in class for order registration.

**Requirements**
1.  Data Source: The data is provided in CSV format. (For more information on CSV, refer to this link).
2.  Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Use the provided DTO classes to read the data from CSV files.
3.  Order Model Transformation: Convert the data from the DTOs into a final Order model.
   
**Data Flow**
1. CSV File → 2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) → 3. Order Model

### Bonus Task: Generic IEnumerable Data Structure<a name="t3"></a>

Develop a Data Structure that Implement IEnumerable interface.

## Final Project <a name="project"></a>

### Part1: Linq Queries <a name="p1"></a>

Write 10 queries using LINQ to retrieve specific information from the SQLite database.

### Part2: Dynamic Filter Expression <a name="p2"></a>

Develop a dynamic filter generator that allows users to create and execute custom (where/orderby/select) clauses on the queries.

### Part3: Plugin Development for Loyalty Club Points Calculation <a name="p3"></a>

Create a plugin system to calculate loyalty club points based on specific rules and conditions.

### Bonus Part: Parallel Loading <a name="p4"></a>

Implement parallel loading of plugins to enhance the performance and responsiveness of the application.
